    "text": "1.1 About the lab\nWelcome to the lab of Dr. Jason Yeatman, Associate Professor in the Graduate School of Education and Department of Psychology at Stanford University and the Division of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine. Our mission is to understand the interplay between brain maturation and cognitive development, with a particular focus on the mechanisms underlying learning to read and how these differ in children with dyslexia. The lab is deeply interdisciplinary, drawing on neuroscience, psychology, education, pediatrics, and engineering to answer both basic scientific and applied questions. A cornerstone of our work is the Rapid Online Assessment of Reading (ROAR)—an online platform for assessing foundational reading skills that consists of a suite of measures validated K-12. Each ROAR measure is delivered through a web browser, is fully automated, and does not require a test administrator, yet rapidly provides precise indices of reading ability with greater precision than many standardized, individually-administered assessments. This research-practice partnership model bridges research and practice, enabling large-scale data collection that helps us develop personalized intervention programs tailored to each child’s unique pattern of brain maturation while advancing our understanding of how reading instruction shapes brain development and plasticity in children, including those with dyslexia.",

We encourage team members of all experience levels and backgrounds to respectfully share their honest opinions and ideas on any topic. Over the years, our group has grown stronger through such respectful, honest input from all team members.\nWe believe that the best science emerges when researchers work closely with educators, clinicians, and communities. This research-practice partnership model extends to our internal lab culture, where we value both rigorous scientific inquiry and the practical application of our work to support children, families, and educators. We are committed to mentorship at all levels and to creating an environment where everyone can learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully to our mission of understanding and supporting the diverse ways children learn to read.\nWe recognize that our work has real-world impact on children’s lives and educational experiences. This responsibility motivates us to maintain the highest standards of scientific integrity, ethical research practices, and respectful collaboration with the schools, families, and communities we serve.",

This means being a safe, supportive, and anti-racist environment in which students and staff from diverse backgrounds are equally and inclusively supported in their education, training, and professional development. Diversity takes many forms and includes, but is not limited to, differences in race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status, religion, disability, neurodiversity, and political affiliation.\nOur research on reading development and dyslexia has shown us that there is no single path to learning—children’s brains and learning profiles are beautifully diverse. This understanding deeply informs how we approach our work with each other in the lab. We believe that diverse teams produce better science and are essential to developing educational tools and interventions that serve all learners equitably.\nWe are committed to ensuring that our research benefits all children, particularly those from historically marginalized and underserved communities who have too often been excluded from educational research and interventions. This commitment extends to our recruitment practices, our collaborations with schools and communities, and our efforts to make tools like ROAR accessible and equitable across diverse populations and contexts.",

Team members will be added to relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols before their start date to ensure they have permission to work with identifiable datasets.\nOne of the most relevant aspects of protecting human subjects in our work is maintaining confidentiality. This is especially critical given that we work with children and collect sensitive neuroimaging, educational, and behavioral data. In practice, this means:\n\nBe sure to understand and comply with project-specific policies about where data can be saved, particularly if the data include personal identifiers. Neuroimaging data, educational records, and assessment results all require special handling.\nDo not share data with anyone without permission, including other members of the group who might not be on the same IRB protocol as you. Always check with a research/partnerships coordinator first.\n\nRemember, data that looks like it does not contain identifiers to you might still be classified as data that requires special protection by our IRB. Always proceed with caution and ask for help if you have any concerns about how to maintain study participant confidentiality.\nWhen working with schools and families, remember that protecting privacy extends beyond data security—be mindful in how you discuss participants and research findings, even in general terms.",

    "text": "7.3 Description of data to be shared\n\n7.3.1 Source of data\nROAR data originate from multiple sources:\nPrimary ROAR assessment data:\n\nStudent responses to ROAR assessments (foundational reading, comprehension, mathematics, executive function, and Spanish assessments) collected through the ROAR Dashboard web application\nData are generated when students complete assessments administered by educators in K-12 schools, districts, and tutoring/after-school centers across the United States\nROAR platform automatically captures response data, timing information, and performance metrics\n\nAdministrative and demographic data:\n\nSchool and district information obtained through Data Use Agreements with participating educational partners\nStudent demographic data (grade level, English Learner status, special education status, etc.) provided by schools/districts\nRoster data imported via CLEVER/ClassLink integration or CSV upload\n\nValidation study data:\n\nStandardized assessment data (Woodcock-Johnson, TOWRE, CTOPP, Read-Aloud assessments) collected by trained research personnel in-person in schools or in the lab\nSurvey data from educators and administrators\nQualitative data from professional development sessions and user experience research\n\nSchool and district context data:\n\nPublicly available data from NCES (Common Core of Data, EdFacts)\nState assessment and accountability data where publicly available\nGeographic and demographic context variables\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Data cleaning and curation\nQuality control procedures:\nAll ROAR assessment data undergo systematic quality control:\n\nValidation of response formats and timing data upon collection\nFlagging of implausible response patterns (e.g., extremely rapid responding, random patterns)\nRemoval of test administrations conducted for demonstration or training purposes\nDetection and removal of duplicate records\n\nData processing pipeline:\nRaw data processing follows a documented, version-controlled workflow:\n\nExtraction: Raw trial-level data extracted from BigQuery database\nValidation: Checks for data completeness, format consistency, and logical integrity\nCleaning: Implementation of exclusion criteria for invalid administrations and assessment scores\nAggregation: Merging of run-level, student-level summary, and trial-level data where necessary\nDocumentation: Generation of data dictionaries, processing logs, and quality reports\nVersioning: All processing code maintained in GitHub\n\nAll cleaning and processing is implemented through reproducible R and Python code pipelines documented in GitHub repositories. The roarutility R package standardizes common data processing tasks.\nCuration workflow:\nData curation responsibilities:\n\nResearch Data Scientist maintains data processing pipelines, generates cleaned datasets, creates documentation\nPartnerships Team validates school/district roster data, manages DUAs, coordinates data transfers\nDevelopment Team ensures data quality at point of collection, implements validation rules in ROAR platform\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Level of aggregation\nROAR data can be shared at multiple levels of aggregation depending on sensitivity, consent, and Data Use Agreement restrictions:\nFor public sharing (when permitted by DUAs and IRB):\n\nDeidentified assessment-level aggregates and models (mean scores, median completion rates, demographic distributions)\n\nFor controlled-access sharing (requires data use agreement):\n\nDeidentified student-level data (student ID replaced with participant ID, direct identifiers removed)\n\nNot shareable:\n\nRaw data containing PII (names, birthdates, email addresses, student IDs from districts)\nData from partners whose DUAs prohibit any external sharing\nSmall-cell data where re-identification risk cannot be adequately mitigated\n\nTypical sharing approach:\nFor most research projects using ROAR data:\n\nDeidentified student-level analytic files for districts/schools with DUA permission\nSchool-level summary files for broader geographic samples\nSynthetic datasets that maintain statistical properties when real data cannot be shared\nComplete documentation, codebooks, and analysis code regardless of data sharing constraints\n\n\n\n7.3.4 Raw vs. clean data\nRaw data (not shareable):\nRaw ROAR data stored in BigQuery contains:\n\nTrial-level and run-level response data with timestamps\nStudent identifiers from source systems (district student IDs)\nIP addresses and session information\n\nRaw data are retained on secure Stanford systems (BigQuery) for the duration required by DUAs and IRB protocols.\nClean, shareable data:\nDe-identified analytic datasets prepared for sharing include:\n\nTrial-level or run-level assessment response data with participant IDs replacing all direct identifiers\nDerived performance metrics (accuracy, reaction time, theta scores, assessment scores)\nDe-identified or generalized demographic variables (grade level, EL status, IEP status)\nGeneralized geographic information (specific school/district names replaced with organization-level IDs)\n\nAll shareable data files are accompanied by:\n\nComprehensive data dictionaries\nCodebooks describing variable derivation and coding\nProcessing scripts showing transformation from raw to analytic data\nREADME files with dataset overview and usage notes\n\n\n\n7.3.5 Number of files and expected rows\nCurrent ROAR data scale (as of 2026):\nROAR has been administered to over 130,000 students across 37+ states. The database contains:\n\nApproximately 5-10 million trial-level response records annually\n130,000-170,000 student-year records\n~2,500-3,000 school-year records\nMultiple assessment types per student (Letter, Word, Sentence, etc.)\n\nTypical research project data structure:\nA research project using ROAR data might produce:\n\n1 trial-level dataset per assessment type (5 ROAR assessments = 5 trial datasets)\n1 run-level summary dataset combining assessments\n1 school-level aggregate dataset\n1 demographic/roster dataset\nMultiple validation study datasets (external assessments, surveys)\n\nLongitudinal studies:\nMulti-year studies generate data files for each assessment administration and school year:\n\n3 administrations × 4 assessment types × 2 school years = 24 trial-level files (can condense this to just 1 large dataset)\nPlus corresponding run-level, demographics, and aggregated files\n\n\n\n7.3.6 Format of data to be shared\nPrimary format: Non-proprietary CSV\nAll shareable ROAR data will be provided as CSV (comma-separated values) files to ensure:\n\nMachine-readability across all statistical platforms\nLong-term accessibility without proprietary software\nEase of use for diverse research teams\n\nCode sharing:\nAll analysis code will be shared via GitHub repositories:\n\nR scripts and R Markdown documents\nPython scripts and Jupyter notebooks",

immediately if any of these occur:\n\nUnauthorized access to data\nLost or stolen device containing data\nAccidental sharing with unauthorized individuals\nData sent to wrong recipient\nMalware or ransomware on systems storing data\nSuspected data breach or unauthorized disclosure\nUSB drive or portable media lost\nPhishing attack targeting team member\nSuspicious access patterns in logs\n\nImmediate Response Steps:\nStep 1: Contain (within minutes)\n\nDisable compromised access immediately\nSecure affected systems\nStop unauthorized sharing\nDisconnect compromised devices from network\n\nStep 2: Notify (within hours) Report to:\n\nStanford IT Security: security@stanford.edu (24 hours)\nPI (Jason Yeatman): immediately\nIRB: Within 5 business days for unanticipated problems involving human subjects\nData providers: Per DUA requirements (typically 24-72 hours)\nFunding sponsors: Per grant/contract terms\n\nStep 3: Document (within 24 hours) Record:\n\nWhat happened and when discovered\nWhat data were involved (type, volume, sensitivity)\nWho was affected (number of individuals, schools)\nWhat systems/devices were involved\nWho has been notified\nWhat containment actions were taken\n\nStep 4: Investigate (ongoing)\n\nCooperate fully with IT Security and other investigators\nPreserve evidence (logs, communications, affected systems)\nDetermine root cause\nAssess scope of impact\n\nStep 5: Remediate (days-weeks)\n\nImplement corrective measures to prevent recurrence\nAddress vulnerabilities\nProvide additional training if needed\nUpdate security procedures\n\nStep 6: Report outcomes (after investigation)\n\nFinal incident report to IRB, funders, data providers as required\nNotification to affected individuals if legally required (e.g., California breach notification law)\nLessons learned documented and shared with team\n\nPrevention Through Documentation:\nTo facilitate both prevention and response, we maintain:\n\nData inventory: What data exist, where stored, who has access\nSecurity configurations: Encryption methods, authentication requirements\nIncident response plan: Step-by-step procedures\nTraining records: Documentation of who completed security training\nDUA register: List of all data use agreements and their security requirements",
