# Culture and Conduct {#sec-culture-and-conduct}

## Lab culture {#sec-lab-culture}

We are committed to a lab culture that is collaborative, supportive, inclusive, open, and free from discrimination and harassment.

Our interdisciplinary approach—spanning neuroscience, education, psychology, pediatrics, and engineering—thrives on diverse perspectives and expertise.
We encourage team members of all experience levels and backgrounds to respectfully share their honest opinions and ideas on any topic.
Over the years, our group has grown stronger through such respectful, honest input from all team members.

We believe that the best science emerges when researchers work closely with educators, clinicians, and communities.
This research-practice partnership model extends to our internal lab culture, where we value both rigorous scientific inquiry and the practical application of our work to support children, families, and educators.
We are committed to mentorship at all levels and to creating an environment where everyone can learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully to our mission of understanding and supporting the diverse ways children learn to read.

We recognize that our work has real-world impact on children's lives and educational experiences.
This responsibility motivates us to maintain the highest standards of scientific integrity, ethical research practices, and respectful collaboration with the schools, families, and communities we serve.

## Diversity, equity, and inclusion {#sec-dei-policy}

The Brain Development & Education Lab recognizes the importance of and is committed to cultivating a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
This means being a safe, supportive, and anti-racist environment in which students and staff from diverse backgrounds are equally and inclusively supported in their education, training, and professional development.
Diversity takes many forms and includes, but is not limited to, differences in race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status, religion, disability, neurodiversity, and political affiliation.

Our research on reading development and dyslexia has shown us that there is no single path to learning—children's brains and learning profiles are beautifully diverse.
This understanding deeply informs how we approach our work with each other in the lab.
We believe that diverse teams produce better science and are essential to developing educational tools and interventions that serve all learners equitably.

We are committed to ensuring that our research benefits all children, particularly those from historically marginalized and underserved communities who have too often been excluded from educational research and interventions.
This commitment extends to our recruitment practices, our collaborations with schools and communities, and our efforts to make tools like ROAR accessible and equitable across diverse populations and contexts.

## Protecting human subjects {#sec-protect-human-subjects}

All lab members must complete [CITI Group 7: IRB BioMed/GCP Research (All Medical Investigators and Staff)](https://irb.stanford.edu/education-compliance/training/citi) Stanford University training and share their certificate with a research coordinator or partnerships coordinator prior to beginning any research activities.
Team members will be added to relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols before their start date to ensure they have permission to work with identifiable datasets.

One of the most relevant aspects of protecting human subjects in our work is maintaining confidentiality.
This is especially critical given that we work with children and collect sensitive neuroimaging, educational, and behavioral data.
In practice, this means:

-   Be sure to understand and comply with project-specific policies about where data can be saved, particularly if the data include personal identifiers.
    Neuroimaging data, educational records, and assessment results all require special handling.

-   Do not share data with anyone without permission, including other members of the group who might not be on the same IRB protocol as you.
    Always check with a research/partnerships coordinator first.

Remember, data that looks like it does not contain identifiers to you might still be classified as data that requires special protection by our IRB.
Always proceed with caution and ask for help if you have any concerns about how to maintain study participant confidentiality.

When working with schools and families, remember that protecting privacy extends beyond data security—be mindful in how you discuss participants and research findings, even in general terms.
